These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). \r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to predict the manner in which people did the exercise. This is the \"classe\" variable in the training set.\r\n\r\n## Content\r\na report describing:\r\n+ how this model is built; \r\n+ how cross validation is used;\r\n+ what the expected out of sample error is;\r\n+ justification of the made choices;\r\n+ Results of prediction model predicting 20 different test cases. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Data \r\nThe training data for this project are available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv\r\n\r\nThe test data are available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv\r\n\r\nThe data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. \r\n\r\nRead more: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har#ixzz3TROgwbfY\r\n\r\nVelloso, E.; Bulling, A.; Gellersen, H.; Ugulino, W.; Fuks, H.
